[Put the NUCLEO-Board on the station to verify the board’s health. Or throw the .bin file to the NUCLEO-board to get internal status.]
Verita project is established to verify the health & report damage of Nucleo MB1136 boards available in the microcontroller class. The inspection kit circuit board & firmware is designed & implemented for use in the inspection process.

Verita project’s mission is to facilitate users to inspect the number of sample boards easily, fast, and continually and assist the user to find the damage point and find a way to fix the sample boards later. The inspection is focused on a power consumption test & peripheral check (GPIO).
